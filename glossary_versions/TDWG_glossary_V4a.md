ORNIS addresses the urgent call for increased access to these data in an open and collaborative manner, and involves development of a suite of online software tools for data analysis and error- checking. This project, funded by the National Science Foundation, expands on existing infrastructure developed for distributed mammal (MaNIS), amphibian and reptile (HerpNet), and fish (FishNet) databases.

It will meet the challenge of understanding biodiversity in a rapidly changing world by accelerating research and distribution of validated information, thereby improving the ability to respond to environmental issues and challenges. The Institute is expected to create additional synergy and efficiencies through the hiring of key positions and the implementation of policies that create collaboration and holistic problem solving.

Our goal is to provide a more integrated and effective framework for those managing biodiversity data on the Web. ViBRANT provides: 1) A virtual research environment (Scratchpads) where users can safely store, share and manage their research information. 2) Analytical services for users to build identification keys and phylogenetic trees. 3) A publication platform for users to automatically compile biodiversity science manuscripts from their research database. 4) A portal for users to centrally access publicly accessible biodiversity research information and literature. 4) Training, helping research communities to use these tools and services. 5) A standards compliant technical architecture that can be sustained by biodiversity research community.
